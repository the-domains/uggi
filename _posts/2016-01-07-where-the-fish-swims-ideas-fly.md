description: 'When I was in Reykjavik, Iceland, last summer on vacation, a peculiar object in a local design store caught my eye. It was a cod that had been turned into a light. Yes, you heard that right: It was a fish, a pretty large one, that had been gutted and deboned, meticulously cleaned and beautifully lacquered, with a small incandescent bulb placed inside its belly.'
